## PodCastAddict (React Edition)

# Purpose

Re-write a existing jquery app, and see the diferences between implementing React and Jquery. I also love podcasts and don't use Itunes, this is a nice easy way to check whats new!


# What it does

This Is a simple app that grabs the top ten, top 100, and lets you search any podcasts on Itunes.

# What I used

React (https://github.com/facebook/react)

Redux (https://github.com/reactjs/redux)

Redux/Sagas (https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga)

Material-UI (https://github.com/callemall/material-ui)
